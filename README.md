This program will allow you to login to all of your mega accounts to avoid deletion due to inactivity.

> Please note while this program should work, it has not been completely tested. Doing so requires waiting for an email from mega saying "[MEGA is missing you!](https://i.imgur.com/OIY3RQq.png)", and then waiting to see if you get the following email "[Your MEGA account is inactive](https://i.imgur.com/quT4Rmk.png)".

## Requirements

You must have MEGAcmd installed and running on your machine. You can download the program here: https://mega.nz/cmd

## Instructions

Create a text file (.txt) of all your mega accounts and passwords in a `user:pass` format with one account per line. Then locate that file and run the program.
